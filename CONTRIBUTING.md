## Development

- **Style:** Enforced by `ruff` (run `ruff check .` and `ruff format .`)
- **Types:** Enforced by `mypy --strict`
- **Tests:** Required for all new features (`pytest`)
- **Commits:** Conventional commits preferred (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)

## Release Integrity

Before cutting releases, generate and verify supply-chain artifacts:

```bash
bash scripts/generate_sbom.sh mcp-firewall:dev
bash scripts/verify_attestation.sh mcp-firewall:dev
```

The CI workflow `.github/workflows/release-security.yml` enforces SBOM presence.
